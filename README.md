## History
### Introduction
The end of the life in the earth such as I know it was about to arrive, a huge mass of people was about to catch me, but... I got it.
### Earth
I am a normal boy who goes to the high-school and in his free time plays videogames, but one day something inside of me changed forever. That day, I looked in the mirror and I did not like anything I saw. After that moment, when I listened a song I imagined myself in a mansion with a rolls-royce, a mercedes, a lamborghini... I imagined myself with t-shirts, hoodies, jerseys and sneakers that cost over one thousands dollars, I imagined myself being millionaire, I created in my mind my own film. Also, I wanted to be the most strong boy of the world and the reality was that I was fat. Well, if something explotes in your face, only you can do two things, give up or fight to achieve your dreams and I chose fight.

The inconvenience is the system. Everybody thinks that I am crazy to choose the option that I chose. For this reason, I am in danger and I have to run away of this planet.

#### Level 2
Mini-game like 'Tetris'.
#### Level 3
Mini-game that consists in run away of the earth in a spaceship.
